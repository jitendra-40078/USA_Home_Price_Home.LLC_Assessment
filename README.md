## **Summary**

In this task, I successfully collected and utilized publicly available datasets to address the impact of key supply-demand factors on US home prices over the last 20 years. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, I gathered historical data from 1987 onward, allowing for a robust examination of long-term trends. I used the S&P Case-Schiller Home Price Index as a reliable proxy for home prices. Through data science modeling techniques, I explored the relationships between this index and various supply-demand factors, such as mortgage rates, unemployment rates, building permits, population growth, and relevant economic indicators. My analysis aimed to uncover the driving forces behind home price fluctuations, contributing valuable insights for understanding the dynamics of the US housing market over the past two decades
